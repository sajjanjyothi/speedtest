Cmake has been used to generate Makefiles

cmake can be installed as
apt-get install cmake (in debian distributions).

How to generate Makefiles
============================
make files can be generated as 
cmake .

How to compile project
=======================
project can ne compiled as 
make clean; make

This will generate binary as speedtest
./speedtestapp: -n count [-H Header-name: Header-value]


Not Implemented
================
Multiple header value appending to the request is not implemented.

Improvements can be done on existing logic
=========================================
1) Restricted number of threads pool can be used to parallelize the request and consolidate the request.This Will be bit more effective , but resource usage for a shorted period will be more.
2) Current implementation can hog the CPU if the number of samples are more. 
3) Single failure on HTTP transaction is treated as failure in this implementation, can be imporved by back off retry mechanism(Design decisions)

UNIT Testing
=============
cunit can be used as a unit test tool for testing internal functions.
